        <h2>License</h2>
        <p>This guide it is released under <em>CC BY-NC-SA v4.0</em>. What does that mean to the layman?</p>
        <p><em>CC</em> = &quot;Creative Commons&quot;. A group of licenses aimed at promoting sharing and creativity.</p>
        <p><em>BY</em> = &quot;Attribution&quot;. Give credit for this guide to its creator(s) and contributor(s).</p>
        <p><em>NC</em> = &quot;NonCommercial&quot;. Don't use this guide for commercial purposes.</p>
        <p><em>SA</em> = &quot;ShareAlike&quot;. If you want to edit this guide or build upon it, go ahead. But if you do, the end result must also be under this license.</p>
        <p>So the longwinded name of the license is:
            <em>Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International</em>.</p>
        <h2>Contributing</h2>
        <p>I would be <em>elated</em> if people wanted to share their knowledge and help expanding this guide. The goal is not to show off what I know, it is to be as helpful as possible.</p>
        <p>To contribute, you can just submit a pull request, add an issue, or if you don't know how to do those things: <em>email me</em>!</p>
        <p>If you contribute, I will add your handle to &quot;Contributors&quot; (unless you don't want me to). If you want to become a co-author, you have to <em>ask</em>, as well as providing a decent amount of contributions and committing (pardon the
            pun) to do things like answer issues....things an author does more than just add content.</p>
        <p>I would request that you <em>please</em> consider contributing or co-authoring before forking (covered below). The point of this guide is to share knowledge. Having multiple versions doesn't ensure that people reading it will get all of it. At
            the very least, there is no harm in asking/suggesting. If we disagree, then by all means, fork away.</p>
        <h3>Guidelines</h3>
        <p>If you decide to contribute, understanding these guidelines will make it easier on everyone.</p>
        <p><strong>Ensure each heading is unique.</strong> Each heading receives a permalink that is based on its text (so &quot;CCleaner&quot; becomes &quot;#ccleaner&quot;). Obviously two sections can't share the same permalink so make new ones different.
            If you truly think that your new section is more logical to have that name than the existing one, the old one can be changed but this should be avoided as it will confuse people who may have boomarked the permalink pointing to the old location.</p>
        <p><strong>Try to build before submitting major changes.</strong> The build process is very automated once you get it set up and instructions are provided in the project Github repo mentioned under <a href="index.html#links-and-downloads">Links and Downloads</a>.
            Building is not absolutely necessary but doing it will help catch things like invalid section references. You also get to take a look at what it will look like finished, which can sometimes help show if something needs to be tweaked or not
            before submitting.</p>
        <p><strong>Only authors can submit changes to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</strong> Ultimately it's up to the authors on what the website should portray. In the early stages they may have it updated with every commit. Later on they may want
            to wait for patch bumps, or even major versions. The point is: to make things less confusing, anyone should be able to submit changes to the repo, but only the authors should decide on when those changes go live.</p>
        <p><strong>Do not write in first person.</strong> So no &quot;I&quot; or &quot;my&quot;, mostly because this guide is/can be written by multiple people. It's also just good writing style if what you are writing is not an opinion piece. So instead
            of &quot;From my experience&quot; use phrases like &quot;There are cases when&quot;.</p>
        <p><strong>Write concisely.</strong> This guide is long enough as it is, try to say only how many words need to be said and no more. The goal is to write for people who will not find the content interesting -to be as accessible as possible. If you
            <em>do</em> want to go off on a tangent, indent it 4 spaces which will turn it into a blockquote; everything in the blockquote should be extra information, i.e. skipping it should not leave the reader confused.</p>
        <p><strong>When writing, have Fun!</strong> This guide is meant to be informative, but it's also meant to be easy to read and <em>fun</em> to create. So it will never read like a Wikipedia article nor is it intended to. There can be jokes and internet
            slang and such.</p>
        <h2>Forks</h2>
        <p>If you've read the last paragraph of the <a href="sharing.html#contributing">Contributing</a> section and you <em>still</em> want to fork, make sure you follow the license's requirements.</p>
        <p>For attribution, just add a block at the beginning of this document for your own version stuff, but leave all the blocks that are already there! You can separate them with a header like &quot;Based on:&quot;</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre><code># robert_paulson's solutions for a slow PC #

        <p>If the guide you are modifying is a modification itself, there will already be a &quot;Based on&quot; section, so just move the current block (robert_paulson's) beneath the &quot;Based on&quot; header like so (abbreviated):</p>
        <pre><code># title thing

        <p>Lastly, remember that the &quot;NoCommercial&quot; clause applies to any derivitive works as well.</p>
